# Carousel

This is my submission to a coding challenge.

## Setup

To run the carousel, clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/brunoparga/carousel.git
$ cd carousel
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

## Development decisions

I am much more accustomed to using `create-react-app` or `expo-cli` to start my projects, rather than starting them bare-bones like this. Therefore, to reduce cognitive load, I won't be using TypeScript here, as that adds overhead to each package I intend to use.
